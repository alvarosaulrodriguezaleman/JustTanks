# Just Tanks
![demo](https://github.com/alvarosaulrodriguezaleman/JustTanks/blob/master/demo.gif)

Simple tanks-esque game made in Lua using the LÃ–VE framework. The game is inspired by the Tanks minigame featured in Wii Play, and it
aims to deliver a similar experience while preserving minimalism and ease of use.

As of now, the game is not more than just a proof of concept, with only a few types of enemies implemented and six different levels.
